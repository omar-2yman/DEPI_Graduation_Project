#ðŸ©º Healthcare Predictive Analytics - Heart Disease Risk Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting heart disease risk using clinical and lifestyle-related patient data. The primary goal is to build and evaluate predictive models that aid in early detection and prevention of cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of mortality globally.

#ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle: Heart Disease Risk Prediction Dataset.

It includes features related to:

-Symptoms (e.g., chest pain, palpitations)

-Clinical indicators (e.g., high cholesterol, blood pressure)

-Lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking, obesity, sedentary lifestyle)

-Medical history (e.g., diabetes, family history)

#ðŸ§  Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
-Handling missing values

-Feature encoding

-Scaling features for better model performance

2. Exploratory Data Analysis
-Feature distribution

-Target variable visualization

-Correlation heatmaps

3. Model Development
-Implemented machine learning models include:

-Logistic Regression

-Random Forest Classifier

-Gradient Boosting Classifier

-Each model is evaluated using:

-Accuracy Score

-Precision, Recall, F1-Score

-Confusion Matrix

-ROC Curve & AUC Score

4. Model Tuning
-Grid Search for hyperparameter optimization

-Regularization techniques

-Feature scaling

5. Feature Importance
Using tree-based models to identify the most significant predictors of heart disease.
